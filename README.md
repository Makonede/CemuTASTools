A set of TAS tools for Cemu, including TASInput, frame advance, and savestates.


# FAQ
- So... where's the code?
  - This repository is currently a placeholder. Development is going well, however, and as soon as I finish the first TAS tool, I will publish it here.
- What are the planned releases?
  - v0.1: TASInput
  - v0.1.1: Macros
  - v0.2: Frame advance
  - v0.3: Movies
  - v0.4: Savestates
  - v1.0: GUI
- Wouldn't Wii U savestates be huge?
  - Yes, but that can't really be fixed. The savestate files will be compressed, reducing their size, but one savestate is still usually around 1 GB. It's just one of those unfortunate quirks of TASing.
- What programming language will CemuTASTools be programmed in?
  - C++.
 
# Secret Project
CemuTASTools is part of a secret, private project. I don't mention it directly anywhere here, but something in CemuTASTools might hint at its existence somewhere... I also may have sprinkled mentions of it here and there across my [Discord server].

This project will becomes public once it is complete. Stay tuned; it's going to be awesome, and you can even try it at home.
