A set of TAS tools for Cemu, including TASInput, frame advance, and savestates.


# FAQ
- So... where's the code?
  - This repository is currently a placeholder. Development is going well, however, and as soon as I finish v0.1, I will publish it here.
- What are the planned releases?
  - v0.1: Frame advance and TASInput
  - v0.2: Movies
  - v0.3: Savestates
  - v1.0: Full release (final tweaks, will be released after Cemu goes open source)
- Wouldn't Wii U savestates be huge?
  - Yes, but that can't really be fixed. The savestate files will be compressed, reducing their size, but one savestate is still usually around 1 GB. It's just one of those unfortunate quirks of TASing.
- What programming language will CemuTASTools be programmed in?
  - Mainly C++, and Python for the GUI.
- How do I contribute?
  - See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Makonede/CemuTASTools/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
 
# Secret Project
CemuTASTools is part of a secret, private project. I don't mention it directly anywhere here, but something in CemuTASTools might hint at its existence somewhere... I also may have sprinkled mentions of it here and there across my <a href="https://discord.gg/wJGnueZ" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.

This project will become public once it is complete. Stay tuned; it's going to be awesome, and you can even try it yourself.
