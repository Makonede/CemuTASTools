In your CemuTASTools directory - the directory containing CemuTASTools.exe - there should be a log file named log.txt.
For us to properly diagnose this bug, you must upload this file.
It is typically located at C:\Program Files\CemuTASTools\log.txt, unless a custom installation directory was set during the installation of CemuTASTools.

Before submitting the bug report, ask yourself these questions:
- Were you incapable of reproducing the bug at least three times?
- Does it only happen on any device other than a 64-bit Windows 10 PC?
- Does it only happen on incompatible Cemu, Cemu hook, and/or CemuTASTools versions?
- Does it only happen with certain Cemu hook code patches enabled?
- Does it only happen with certain Cemu graphic packs enabled?
- Does it only happen with an Intel GPU?
- Does it only happen in titles rated Runs or lower, rated Unknown, or not present in the Cemu Compatibility List (http://compat.cemu.info)?
- Does it only happen with a modified Cemu, Cemu hook, or CemuTASTools client?
If the answer to any of these questions is "yes," the bug report is invalid and should not be submitted.
