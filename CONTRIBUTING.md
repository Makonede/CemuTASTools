# Issue/PR style guide
- Always use English.
- Use proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization.
  - Always use Oxford commas.
- Keep language as formal as possible.

- Do not insert images of text or code. Always insert either a Pastebin link to the text or the text itself.
- Do not insert photographs or camera recordings of your screen. Always insert screenshots or screen recordings.
  - Windows has a built-in screenshot tool, accessible with `Win+Shift+S`.
  - For videos, you can use the built-in Xbox Game Bar screen recording tool (`Win+Alt+R`) or third-party software like Streamlabs Desktop.
- Do not make irrelevant or unnecessary comments on issues or PRs.
- Always fill out the issue and PR templates fully. Leave any sections that do not apply exactly as they are.
  - Issues and PRs that are not fully filled out will be closed without comment.
